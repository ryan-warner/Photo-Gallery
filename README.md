A hands-free photo gallery built around NodeJS

This system enables the sharing of high quality images at any desired scale, with minimal user input. Instead of relying upon the user to write folder-specific webpages, the system runs through the library made available to it and serves the necessary pages. 

## Project Background
My grandparents captured their lives through the lens of a 35mm camera. My family and I have taken on the task of scanning the hundreds of 35mm slides that they have collected over the years into a digital format. Not all of these photos are photos that we would share on typical social media platforms, but all have intrinsic value to our family and close friends. I wanted to create something that I could use to share these photos with these people, where they could look through these photos, relive their memories, and save those that they feel are the most important. I also wanted to provide a means through which my grandmother might be able to easily access and view these photos, as someone who isn't incredibly comfortable with modern computers. 

I'm just a busy college student who started this project while in the midst of quarantine after contracting COVID-19. I'm hoping to devote considerable time to bringing this project into a truly functional state after returning home for Thanksgiving. As of right now, here is where the project stands:

## Features:
- Automatic indexing of library contents
- Parsing of album names into album-specific URLs and headings
- More coming later

## Future Development
- [x] Automatic sorting of album images into a responsive layout within the album-specific page
- [x] Scripted context menu enabling selective download of images at the qualities provided by the user
- [x] Thumbnail preference controls that enable a shift between fitting to a square div or filling the square div
- [x] Complete homepage redesign
- [x] Sitewide CSS styling
- [x] Lightbox functionality
- [ ] Explore the possibility of internal image resampling, conversion, and thumbnail generation
- [ ] Rework gallery indexing logic by eliminating hardcoded approach
- [ ] Explore the possibilty of online site creation logic
  - [ ] Welcome page if no content is found
  - [ ] Uploading folders to the correct directories, followed by internal processing of these uploads

In-progress tasks are marked with a check

## Installation and Usage
More details coming soon... (As the project becomes truly usable)
